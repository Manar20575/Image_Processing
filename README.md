# Image Processing 
<br>
➢ refers to processing digital images by means of a digital computer.
<br>
# Digital image processing focus on two major tasks:
<br>
➢ Improvement of pictorial information for human interpretation.
<br>
➢ Processing of image data for tasks such as storage, transmission, and extraction of
pictorial information.

➢ Rgb2gray
<br>
➢ Rgb2binary
<br>
➢ gray2binary
<br>
➢ point processing- "brightness, negative, contrast".
<br>
➢ point processing - gamma correction.
<br>
➢ histogram, histogram equalization.
<br>
➢ Convolution.
<br>
➢ Blurring- "MeanFilter, WeightFilter".
➢ Edge Detection-"PointDetection, HorizontalDetection, VerticalDetection, DiagonalLeftDetection, DiagonalRightDetection".
➢ Sharpening- "PointSharpening, HorizontalSharpening, VerticalSharpening, DiagonalLeftSharpening, DiagonalRightSharpening".
➢ Fourier transfrom, Inverse fourier transform
➢ frequency domain filters- "Ideal low pass filter, Gaussian low pass filter, Butterworth low pass filter, Ideal high pass filter, Gaussian high pass filter, Butterworth high pass filter".
➢ Salt&Pepper, Uniform, Gaussian noise. 
➢ order filters- "min, max, median and midpoint".
